PathSolver-G2 – Campus Navigation Logic Engine

This project implements a campus navigation system using two logic
programming paradigms:

1. Prolog 
2. ASP with Clingo 

The system computes valid walking routes between buildings on a
university campus and identifies the shortest path using optimization.




You will see multiple models and an optimized shortest path.
