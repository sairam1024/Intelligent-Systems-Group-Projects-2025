How to Run the Prolog Navigation Solver
---------------------------------------

1. Open terminal in:
   PathSolver-G2/logic_engines/pl_engine/

2. Start Prolog:
   swipl

3. Load the navigation engine:
   ?- [nav_solver].

4. Example Queries:
   ?- route(library, cafeteria, Route).
   ?- route(engineering, parking, Route).
   ?- route(library, auditorium, Path).

5. Expected Output:
   Route = [library, quad, engineering, cafeteria]
   etc.

This engine uses DFS recursion to expand possible routes.
