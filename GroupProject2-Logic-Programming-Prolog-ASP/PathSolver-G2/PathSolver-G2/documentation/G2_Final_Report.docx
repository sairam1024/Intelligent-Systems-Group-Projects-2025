# Group 2 – Campus Navigation Logic Engine
## Final Project Report

### 1. Introduction
This report presents a navigation engine developed using logic
programming techniques. The system models a university campus map
and computes valid walking routes between buildings. Two engines
were implemented: a Prolog-based pathfinder and an ASP/Clingo
optimization model.

### 2. Problem Description
The goal is to determine valid routes between buildings and compute
the shortest walking path. The campus graph consists of seven
locations connected by walkable edges. Logic programming is used
to represent relationships, recursion, and constraints.

### 3. Prolog Engine
The Prolog module implements a depth-first search (DFS) route
finder using recursion and backtracking. The implementation
includes cycle prevention and path construction.

Example:
?- route(library, auditorium, P).

Output:
P = [library, quad, engineering, cafeteria, auditorium].

### 4. ASP Engine
The ASP module defines edges, recursive reachability, constraints,
and an optimization rule to minimize steps.

Clingo output:
- 6 valid answer sets
- Optimum route has 4 steps
- Shortest path confirmed

### 5. Comparison
Prolog excels in recursive traversal and returning ordered paths.
ASP excels in constraint-based optimization, generating multiple
candidate solutions and selecting the shortest.

### 6. Conclusion
The project demonstrates Prolog and ASP for intelligent navigation.
Both engines successfully compute valid paths, while ASP additionally
computes the shortest route using optimization.
